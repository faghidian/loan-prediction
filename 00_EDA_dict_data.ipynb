The data consists of a set of variables that describe the requested loan and the applicant's credit attributes (annual income, debt-to-income ratio, number of credit inquiries in the last 6 months, etc.). These data are based on actual real-life loans obtained publicly with some modifications. We have split the data into two separate datasets, one for training the model and the other for validating it. We also provide a data dictionary, which contains brief descriptions of the meaning of each variable. Note: Not all of the variables are suitable for constructing the model. You will have to do some variable inspection and exploratory data analysis to determine which ones to use.\""
